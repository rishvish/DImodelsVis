\usage{

  data,
  prop = NULL,
  pie_positions = c(0, 0.5, 1),
  pie_colours = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame created using the \code{\link{simplex_path_data}} function.}

\item{prop}{A vector of column names or indices identifying the columns containing the
species proportions in the data. Will be inferred from the data if
it is created using the `\code{\link{simplex_path_data}}`
function, but the user also has the flexibility of manually
specifying the values.}

\item{pie_positions}{A numeric vector with values between 0 and 1 (both inclusive)
indicating the positions along the X-axis at which to
show pie-glyphs for each curve. Default is c(0, 0.5, 1) meaning
that pie-glyphs with be shown at the start, midpoint and end
of each curve.}

\item{pie_colours}{A character vector indicating the colours for the slices
in the pie-glyphs. \cr
If left NULL, the colour blind friendly colours will be
for the pie-glyph slices.}

\item{se}{A boolean variable indicating whether to plot confidence intervals associated with
the effect of species increase or decrease}

\item{facet_var}{A character string or numeric index identifying the column
in the data to be used for faceting the plot into multiple
panels.}

\item{nrow}{Number of rows in which to arrange the final plot
(when `add_var` is specified).}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in which to arrange the final plot
(when `add_var` is specified).}
}
\value{
A ggmultiplot (ggplot if single plot is returned) class object or data-frame (if `plot = FALSE`)
}
\description{
The helper function for plotting the change in a response variable over a
straight line between two points across the simplex space. The output of the
\code{\link{simplex_path_data}} function (with any desired modifications)
should be passed here. The generated plot will show individual curves
indicating the variation in the response between the points.
`\code{\link[PieGlyph:PieGlyph-package]{Pie-glyphs}}` are
used to highlight the compositions of the starting, ending and midpoint of the
straight line between the two points.

## Load data
data(sim2)

## Fit model
mod <- glm(response ~ (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4)^2 + 0, data = sim2)

## Visualise change as we move from the centroid community to each monoculture
plot_data <- simplex_path_data(starts = sim2[c(19, 20, 19, 20), ],
                               ends = sim2[c(47, 52, 55, 60), ],
                               prop = c("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"),
                               model = mod)
simplex_path_plot(data = plot_data, prop = c("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"))

## Show specific curves
simplex_path_plot(data = plot_data[plot_data$.Group \%in\% c(1, 4), ],
                  prop = c("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"))

## Show uncertainty using `se = TRUE`
simplex_path_plot(data = plot_data[plot_data$.Group \%in\% c(1, 4), ],
                  prop = c("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"), se = TRUE)

## Change colours of pie-glyphs using `pie_colours`
simplex_path_plot(data = plot_data[plot_data$.Group \%in\% c(1, 4), ],
                  prop = c("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"), se = TRUE,
                  pie_colours = c("steelblue1", "steelblue4", "orange1", "orange4"))

## Show pie-glyphs at different points along the curve using `pie_positions`
simplex_path_plot(data = plot_data[plot_data$.Group \%in\% c(1, 4), ],
                  prop = c("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"), se = TRUE,
                  pie_positions = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
                  pie_colours = c("steelblue1", "steelblue4", "orange1", "orange4"))

## Facet plot based on specific variables
simplex_path_plot(data = plot_data,
                  prop = c("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"), se = TRUE,
                  facet_var = "block",
                  pie_colours = c("steelblue1", "steelblue4", "orange1", "orange4"))

## Simulataneously create multiple plots for additional variables
sim2$block <- as.numeric(sim2$block)
new_mod <- update(mod, ~ . + block, data = sim2)
plot_data <- simplex_path_data(starts = sim2[c(18), 3:6],
