visualise_effects_data(

\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe specifying the initial communities of interest for which
to visualise the effect of increasing/decreasing a variable.
If a model object is specified then this data should contain all the
variables present in the model object including any additional variables
not part of the simplex design.
If a coefficient vector is specified then data should contain same number of
columns as the number of elements in the coefficient vector and a one-to-one
positional mapping would be assumed between the data columns and the
elements of the coefficient vector.}

\item{prop}{A vector of column names or indices identifying the columns containing the
variable proportions (i.e., compositional columns) in the data.}

\item{var_interest}{A character vector specifying the variable for which to visualise
the effect of change on the response. If left blank,
all variables would be assumed to be of interest.}

\item{effect}{One of "increase", "decrease" or "both" to indicate whether to
look at the effect of increasing the proportion, decreasing the
proportion or doing both simultaneously, respectively on the response.
The default in "increasing".}

\item{add_var}{A list specifying values for additional variables
in the model other than the proportions (i.e. not part of the simplex design).
This would be useful to compare the predictions across
different values for a categorical variable.
One plot will be generated for each unique combination
of values specified here.}

\item{prediction}{A logical value indicating whether to pass the final data to
`\link{add_prediction}` and add predictions to the data.
Default value is \code{TRUE}, but often it would be desirable
to make additional changes to the data before making any
predictions, so the user can set this to \code{FALSE} and
manually call the `\link{add_prediction}` function.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=add_prediction]{add_prediction}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{model}}{A regression model object which will be used to make predictions
for the observations in `data`. Will override `coefficients`
if specified.}
    \item{\code{coefficients}}{If a regression model is not available (or can't be fit in R),
the regression coefficients from a model fit in some other
language can be used to calculate predictions. However, the
user would have to ensure there's an appropriate one-to-one
positional mapping between the data columns and the
coefficient values. Further, the would also have to provide
a variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients in the `vcov`
parameter if they want the associated CI for the prediction or
it would not be possible to calculate confidence/prediction
intervals using this method.}
    \item{\code{vcov}}{If regression coefficients are specified, then the variance-covariance
matrix of the coefficients can be specified here to calculate the
associated confidence interval around each prediction. Failure to do
so would result in no confidence intervals being returned. Ensure
`coefficients` and `vcov` have the same positional mapping with the data.}
    \item{\code{coeff_cols}}{If `coefficients` are specified and a one-to-one positional
mapping between the data-columns and coefficient vector is
not present. A character string or numeric index can be specified
here to reorder the data columns and match the corresponding
coefficient value to the respective data column. See the
"Use model coefficients for prediction" section in examples.}
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{The confidence level for calculating confidence/prediction
intervals. Default is 0.95.}
    \item{\code{interval}}{Type of interval to calculate:
\describe{
  \item{"none" (default)}{No interval to be calculated.}
  \item{"confidence"}{Calculate a confidence interval.}
  \item{"prediction"}{Calculate a prediction interval.}
}}
  }}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns appended at the end
 \describe{
   \item{.Sp}{An identifier column to discern the variable of interest being modified in each curve.}
   \item{.Proportion}{The value of the variable of interest within the community.}
   \item{.Group}{An identifier column to discern between the different curves.}
   \item{.add_str_ID}{An identifier column for grouping the cartesian product
                      of all additional columns specified in `add_var`
                      parameter (if `add_var` is specified).}
   \item{.Pred}{The predicted response for each observation.}
   \item{.Lower}{The lower limit of the prediction/confidence interval for each observation.}
   \item{.Upper}{The upper limit of the prediction/confidence interval for each observation.}
   \item{.Marginal}{The marginal change in the response (first derivative) with respect to the
                    gradual change in the proportion of the species of interest.}
   \item{.Threshold}{A numeric value indicating the maximum proportion of the species of interest
                     within a particular community which results in a positive marginal effect on the response.}
   \item{.MarEffect}{A character string entailing whether the increase/decrease of the species of interest from the
                     particular community would result in a positive or negative marginal effect on the response.}
   \item{.Effect}{An identifier column signifying whether considering the effect of species addition or species decrease.}

\description{
The helper function to create the underlying data for visualising the effect
of increasing or decreasing (or both) the proportion of a variable from a
set of compositional variables. This is a special case of the
\code{\link{suggest_name}} function where the end points are either the
monoculture (i.e. variable of interest = 1, while all others equal 0) of the
variable of interest (when increasing the proportion) or a community without
the variable of interest (when decreasing the proportion). The observations
specified in `data` are connected to the respective communities with a straight
line across the simplex, this has the effect of changing the proportion of
the variable of interest whilst adjusting the proportion of the other variables
but keeping their proportions unchanged, thereby preserving the compositional
nature of the data. This enables us to visualise the effect of changing the
proportion of a variable of interest. See examples for more information.
The output of this function can be passed to the
\code{\link{visualise_effects_plot}} function to visualise the results.
