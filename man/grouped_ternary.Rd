}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A Diversity Interactions model object fit by using the
\code{\link[DImodels:DI]{DI()}} function from the
\code{\link[DImodels:DImodels-package]{DImodels}} package.}

\item{FG}{A character vector specifying the groupings of the variables specified in `prop`.}

\item{values}{A numeric vector specifying the proportional split of the variables within a group.
The default is to split the group proportion equally between
each variable in the group.}

\item{tern_vars}{A character vector giving the names of the three variables
to be shown in the ternary diagram.}

\item{conditional}{A data-frame describing the names of the compositional variables
and their respective values at which to slice the
simplex space. The format should be, for example, as follows: \cr
\code{data.frame("p1" = c(0, 0.5), "p2" = c(0.2, 0.1))} \cr
One figure would be created for each row in `conditional` with
the respective values of all specified variables. Any
compositional variables not specified in `conditional` will
be assumed to be 0.}

\item{add_var}{A list or data-frame specifying values for additional variables
in the model other than the proportions (i.e. not part of the
simplex design).
This could be useful for comparing the predictions across
different values for a non-compositional variable.
If specified as a list, it will be expanded to show a plot
for each unique combination of values specified, while if specified
as a data-frame, one plot would be generated for each row in the
data.}

\item{resolution}{A number between 1 and 10 describing the resolution of the
resultant graph.
A high value would result in a higher definition figure
but at the cost of being computationally expensive.}

\item{plot}{A boolean variable indicating whether to create the plot or return
the prepared data instead. The default \code{TRUE} creates the plot while
\code{FALSE} would return the prepared data for plotting. Could be useful
if user wants to modify the data first and then create the plot.}

\item{nlevels}{The number of levels to show on the contour map.}

\item{colours}{A character vector or function specifying the colours for the
contour map or points. The number of colours should be same as
`nlevels` if (`show = "contours"`). \cr
The default colours scheme is the
\code{\link[grDevices:terrain.colors]{terrain.colors()}} for
continuous variables and an extended version of the Okabe-Ito
colour scale for categorical variables.}

\item{lower_lim}{A number to set a custom lower limit for the contour
(if `show = "contours"`). The default is minimum of the prediction.}

\item{upper_lim}{A number to set a custom upper limit for the contour
(if `show = "contours"`). The default is maximum of the prediction.}

\item{contour_text}{A boolean value indicating whether to include labels on
the contour lines showing their values
(if `show = "contours"`). The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{show_axis_labels}{A boolean value indicating whether to show axis
labels along the edges of the ternary. The default
is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{show_axis_guides}{A boolean value indicating whether to show axis
guides within the interior of the ternary. The
default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{axis_label_size}{A numeric value to adjust the size of the axis labels
in the ternary plot. The default size is 4.}

\item{vertex_label_size}{A numeric value to adjust the size of the vertex
labels in the ternary plot. The default size is 5.}

\item{nrow}{Number of rows in which to arrange the final plot
(when `add_var` is specified).}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in which to arrange the final plot
(when `add_var` is specified).}
}
\value{
A ggmultiplot (ggplot if single plot is returned) class object or data-frame (if `plot = FALSE`)
}
\description{
Grouped ternary diagrams are created by combining the proportions of the
compositional variables into groups and visualising these groups on a 2-d
ternary diagram. These are very useful when we have multiple compositional
variables that can be grouped together by some hierarchical grouping structure.
For example, grouping species in a ecosystem based on the functions they perform,
or grouping political parties based on their national alliances. Grouping
variables this way allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the compositional
data and visualise it. This is akin to looking at a 2-d slice of the high
dimensional simplex. The relative proportions of each variable within a group
can be adjusted to look at different slices of the simplex. Looking at multiple
such slices would enable us to create an approximation of how the response varies
across the original n-dimensional simplex.
This is a wrapper function specifically for statistical models fit using the
\code{\link[DImodels:DI]{DI()}} function from the
\code{\link[DImodels:DImodels-package]{DImodels}} R package and would implicitly
call \code{\link{grouped_ternary_data}} followed by
\code{\link{grouped_ternary_plot}}. If your model object isn't fit using
DImodels, consider calling these functions manually.

\examples{
library(DImodels)
library(dplyr)
data(sim3)
m1 <- DI(y = "response", prop = paste0("p", 1:9),
         DImodel = "AV", data = sim3) \%>\%
         suppressWarnings()

## We have nine (p1 to p9) variables here and using `conditional_ternary`
## to visualise the simplex space won't be very helpful as there are too
## variables to condition on
## Instead we group the nine-variables into three groups called "G", "L" and "H"
grouped_ternary(model = m1, FG = c("G","G","G","G","G","L","L","H","H"),
                resolution = 1)
## By default the variables within a group take up an equal share of the
## group proportion. So for example, each point along the above ternary
## would have a 50:50 split of the variables in the group "L" or "H", thus
## the vertex where "L" is 1, would mean that p6 and p7 are 0.5 each,
## similarly, the vertex "H" is made up of 0.5 of p8 and p9 while the "G"
## vertex is comprised of 0.2 of each of p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5. The concepts
## also extend to points along the edges and interior of the ternary.

## We can also manually specify the split of the species within a group
## This would mean we are looking at a different slice of the simplex
## For example this would mean the groups "L" group is made up of 100\% of
## p7 and doesn't contain any p6, while "H" group contains 30\% of p8 and
## 70\% of p9, while "G" group still contains 20\% of each p1 to p5.
grouped_ternary(m1, FG = c("G","G","G","G","G","L","L","H","H"),
                resolution = 1,
                values = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2,
                           0, 1,
                           0.3, 0.7))

## If here are more than three groups then, we could condition some groups
## to have a fixed value while three groups are manipulated within a ternary
## The group "G" is now split into two groups "G1" and "G2"
## We can create conditional ternary diagram at the grouped level as well
## Notice the values going in `tern_vars` and `conditional` are names
## of the groups and not the original compositional variables
grouped_ternary(m1, FG = c("G1","G1","G2","G2","G2","L","L","H","H"),
                resolution = 1,
                tern_vars = c("G1", "L", "H"),
                conditional = data.frame("G2" = c(0, 0.25, 0.5)))

## Specify `plot = FALSE` to not create the plot but return the prepared data
head(grouped_ternary(m1, FG = c("G1","G1","G2","G2","G2","L","L","H","H"),
                     resolution = 1, plot = FALSE,
                     tern_vars = c("G1", "L", "H"),
                     conditional = data.frame("G2" = c(0, 0.25, 0.5))))

## All other functionality from \code{\link{condtional_ternary_plot}} is
## available in this function too.
