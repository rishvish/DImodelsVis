\usage{
conditional_ternary_data(
  prop,
  tern_vars,
  conditional = NULL,
  add_var = list(),
  resolution = 3,
  prediction = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prop}{A character vector indicating the model coefficients
corresponding to variable proportions. These variables should
be compositional in nature (i.e., proportions should sum to 1).}

\item{tern_vars}{A character vector giving the names of the three variables
to be shown in the ternary diagram.}

\item{conditional}{A data-frame describing the names of the variables
and their respective values at which to slice the
simplex space. The format should be, for example, as follows: \cr
\code{data.frame("p1" = c(0, 0.5), "p2" = c(0.2, 0.1))} \cr
Once figure would be created for row in `conditional` with
the respective values of all specified variables. Any
compositional variables not specified in `conditional` will
be assumed to be 0.}

\item{add_var}{A list specifying values for additional variables
in the model other than the proportions (i.e. not part of the
simplex design).
This could be useful for comparing the predictions across
different values for a non-compositional variable.
One ternary plot will be generated for each unique combination
of values specified here.}

\item{resolution}{A number between 1 and 5 describing the resolution of the
resultant graph.
A high value would result in a higher definition figure
but at the cost of being computationally expensive.}

\item{prediction}{A logical value indicating whether to pass the final data
to the `\link{add_prediction}` function and append the
predictions to the data. Default value is \code{TRUE}, but
often it would be desirable to make additional changes to
the data before making any predictions, so the user can set this to
\code{FALSE} and manually call the `\link{add_prediction}`
function.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=add_prediction]{add_prediction}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{model}}{A regression model object which will be used to make predictions
for the observations in `data`. Will override `coefficients`
if specified.}
    \item{\code{coefficients}}{If a regression model is not available (or can't be fit in R),
the regression coefficients from a model fit in some other
language can be used to calculate predictions. However, the
user would have to ensure there's an appropriate one-to-one
positional mapping between the data columns and the
coefficient values. Further, the would also have to provide
a variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients in the `vcov`
parameter if they want the associated CI for the prediction or
it would not be possible to calculate confidence/prediction
intervals using this method.}
    \item{\code{vcov}}{If regression coefficients are specified, then the variance-covariance
matrix of the coefficients can be specified here to calculate the
associated confidence interval around each prediction. Failure to do
so would result in no confidence intervals being returned. Ensure
`coefficients` and `vcov` have the same positional mapping with the data.}
    \item{\code{coeff_cols}}{If `coefficients` are specified and a one-to-one positional
mapping between the data-columns and coefficient vector is
not present. A character string or numeric index can be specified
here to reorder the data columns and match the corresponding
coefficient value to the respective data column. See the
"Use model coefficients for prediction" section in examples.}
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{The confidence level for calculating confidence/prediction
intervals. Default is 0.95.}
    \item{\code{interval}}{Type of interval to calculate:
\describe{
  \item{"none" (default)}{No interval to be calculated.}
  \item{"confidence"}{Calculate a confidence interval.}
  \item{"prediction"}{Calculate a prediction interval.}
}}
  }}
}
\value{
A data-frame containing compositional columns with names specified
        in `prop` parameter along with any additional columns specified in
        `add_var` parameter. The first five columns of the data contain the
        three variables (specified in `tern_vars`) shown in the ternary along
        with their 2-d projection and should not be modified. The following
        additional columns could also be present in the data.
 \describe{
   \item{.x}{The x-projection of the points within the ternary.}
   \item{.y}{The y-projection of the points within the ternary.}
   \item{.add_str_ID}{An identifier column for grouping the cartesian product
                      of all additional columns specified in `add_var`
                      parameter (if `add_var` is specified).}
   \item{.Sp}{An identifier column specifying the variable(s) along which the
              high dimensional simplex is sliced.}
   \item{.Value}{The value(s) (between 0 and 1) along the direction of variable(s)
                 in `.Sp` at which the high dimensional simplex is sliced.}
   \item{.Facet}{An identifier column formed by combining `.Sp` and `.value`
                 to group observations within a specific slice of the
                 high dimensional simplex.}
   \item{.Pred}{The predicted response for each observation
                (if `prediction` is \code{TRUE}).}
   \item{.Lower}{The lower limit of the prediction/confidence interval
                 for each observation.}
   \item{.Upper}{The upper limit of the prediction/confidence interval
                 for each observation.}
 }
}
\description{
The helper function for preparing the underlying data for creating conditional
ternary diagrams, where the high dimensional simplex is sliced at various
values along the range of a particular variable(s) by conditioning the variables
to have a fixed value and we visualise the change in the response with respect
to the remaining three variables in a ternary diagram such that the proportions
within the ternary would sum to 1 - x, where x is the sum of all values at which
the different variables are conditioned. The output of this function can be passed to the
\code{\link{conditional_ternary_plot}} function to plot the results. Viewing multiple
2-d slices across multiple variables should allow to create an approximation of
how the response varies across the n-dimensional simplex.
